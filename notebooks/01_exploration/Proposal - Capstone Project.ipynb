There could be a million different reasons why you buy something that you don't like. There are algorithms for this (extension of the ALS models. Could start with implicit feedback recommendations using ALS). Look for package that is doing this very quickly /. this one building a model to make predictions.\n",

We are assuming that these people have similair tastes to you. And then all of these things might be a good suggestion to me as well. this one we are using huristics tyo try and figure out what is similair.
