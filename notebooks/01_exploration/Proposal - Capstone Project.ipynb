Therefore, if Alice and Bob have rated movies in a similar way in the past, then one can use Alice’s observed ratings on the movie Terminator to predict Bob’s unobserved ratings on this movie. In general, the k most similar users to Bob can be used to make rating predictions for Bob. Similarity functions are computed between the rows of the ratings matrix to discover similar users.”\n",

    "* “A special case of ratings is that of unary ratings, in which there is a mechanism for a user to specify a liking for an item but no mechanism to specify a dislike. Unary ratings are particularly common, especially in the case of implicit feedback data sets [259, 260, 457]. In these cases, customer preferences are derived from their activities rather than their explicitly specified ratings. For example, the buying behavior of a customer can be converted to unary ratings. When a customer buys an item, it can be viewed as a preference for the item. However, the act of not buying an item from a large universe of possibilities does not always indicate a dislike. Similarly, many social networks, such as Facebook, use “like” buttons, which provide the ability to express liking for an item. However, there is no mechanism to specify dislike for an item. The implicit feedback setting can be viewed as the matrix completion analog of the positive-unlabeled (PU) learning problem in data classification [259].”\n",

    "* “An example of a unary ratings matrix is illustrated in Figure 1.3(b). For cases in which the ratings are unary, the matrix is referred to as a positive preference utility matrix because it allows only the specification of positive preferences. The two matrices in Figure 1.3 have the same set of observed entries, but they provide very different insights. For example, the users U 1 and U 3 are very different in Figure 1.3(a) because they have very different ratings for their mutually specified entries. On the other hand, these users would be considered very similar in Figure 1.3(b) because these users have expressed a positive preference for the same items. The ratings-based utility provides a way for users to express negative preferences for items. For example, user U 1 does not like the movie Gladiator in Figure 1.3(a). There is no mechanism to specify this in the positive-preference utility matrix of Figure 1.3(b) beyond a relatively ambiguous missing entry. In other words, the matrix in Figure 1.3(b) is less expressive. While Figure 1.3(b) provides an example of a binary matrix, it is possible for the nonzero entries to be arbitrary positive values. For example, they could correspond to the quantities of items bought by the different users. In general, unary matrices are created by user actions such as buying an item, and are therefore also referred to as implicit feedback matrices.”\n",

Another example is the case in which a particular type of festival or holiday affects the underlying customer activity.\n",
    "It has generally been observed that the use of such contextual information can greatly improve the effectiveness of the recommendation process. Context-based recommender systems are incredibly powerful because the underlying ideas are relevant to a wide variety of domain-specific settings. In fact, a recurring theme throughout the later chapters of the book, will be the use of a multidimensional model [7] for context-specific recommendations in different domain-specific settings. Context-aware recommender systems will be discussed in Chapter 8 in a general sense. However, individual aspects of the context, such as time, location, and social information, are studied in detail in other chapters. A general review of these different aspects is provided below.”\n",
