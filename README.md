## Project Description
(Provide more detailed overview of the project.  Talk a bit about your data sources and what questions and hypothesis you are exploring. What specific data analysis/visualization and modelling work are you using to solve the problem? What blockers and challenges are you facing?  Feel free to number or bullet point things here)


## Getting Started
1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](https://github.com/mishaberrien/recipe_recommendation_system/tree/master/data-sample) within this repo.
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](https://github.com/mishaberrien/recipe_recommendation_system/tree/master/results)
4. In order to run the scripts you'll need to change the data location name to the ```data-sample``` folder.
